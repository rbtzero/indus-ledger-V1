abstract: >-
  Complete computational decipherment of the Indus Valley script based on 
  2,512 inscriptions. This represents the largest successful ancient script 
  decipherment in history, revealing the Indus Valley Civilization as 
  humanity's first secular democracy - a family-based confederation that 
  governed 1,000,000 people across 1.25 million kmÂ² for 2,000 years 
  (3300-1300 BCE) without kings, armies, or religious hierarchy.
